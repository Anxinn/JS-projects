        <p>Both Chrome and Firefox have excellent JavaScript consoles, also known as DevTools, for debugging your
            JavaScript.

            You can find Developer tools in your Chrome's menu or Web Console in FireFox's menu. If you're using a
            different browser, or a mobile phone, we strongly recommend switching to desktop Firefox or Chrome.

            The console.log()method, which "prints" the output of what's within its parentheses to the console, will
            likely be the most helpful debugging tool. Placing it at strategic points in your code can show you the
            intermediate
            <img src="img1/p6.jpg" class="l">
            values of variables. It's good practice to have an idea of what the output should be before
            looking at what it is. Having check points to see the status of your calculations throughout your code will
            help narrow down where the problem is.
